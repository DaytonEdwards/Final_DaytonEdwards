    <p>This section is mostly considered the boring topic, but what may surprise you is that your nutrition makes up 70% of your body composition while trying to lose or gain weight. While sleep and exercise takes up the rest of that percent.</p>
    <p> Nutrition comes down to three basic macros called "protein","fats", and "carbs". These are the main components of your health. Yes, there are other things to worry about but these are the big three to worry about to most. The biggest task and recommendation is to get a good ratio of that food such as a 45%-carb, 20%-protein, and 35%-fats.</p>
    <p> The next issue to solve is your calorie intake, the best way to find your amount is to look up your "BMR" or "Basal Matabolic Rate", you can look this up anywhere and just fill out your stats. After that is complete you will need to add that to your activity levels or just look up your "TDEE" or "Total Daily Engergy Expenditure" which is your BMR and activity levels combined to give you your end amount to eat. Once you find that out, let's say you want to lose weight the best course of action is to lower your calorie intake by 300 from what that calculator gave you so that you lose around 0.80 lbs per week.

        The next part to consider is if you have any type of personal issues, such an allergy to foods. This can be easily adjustable, but please make sure before you go on a diet you watch out for that. Something else to consider with a diet is that people believe you have to eat these weird and nasty foods to lose weight but in reality you could eat McDonalds every day and still lose weight as long as you are staying in a calorie deficit like explained above. It's Best not to do that for health reasons. Going back to what was being said, you can eat your favorite foods in moderation, so don't be worried you can't enjoy that pizza ever again.

        The last topic with nutrition we need to cover is your greens and fruits. Everybody needs these daily in order to get their needed vitamins, which in the long run makes your immune system way stronger and makes you enjoy your life just that much better. Just remember after everything that has been said that you eat well because this body you have is what you'll be stuck with for the rest of your life so you better take care of it while you have it.
