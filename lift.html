    <p> This page goes over the liftin aspect of staying healthy. There are many ways to do this such as lifting heavyweights, light weights, body weight, cardio, and many other ways to perform healthy practices.</p>
    <p> The most common option of lifting is heavy lifting/light with weights in a gym such as a barbell, dumbells, and many other tools in that gym. This type of lifting is the best due to the most amount of room for growth and resistance allowing your body to grow faster and for a longer period of time.</p>
    <p> To start this process you should find a personal trainer if possible to help guide you in a safe path of lifting or else you could get injured. The best places to look for a personal trainers are at public gyms in your are and make sure to check those reviews! Once you get that all sorted out just start at a light weight till you start to get a better sense of your body and form and then go up from there. After around 3-4 months of supervision, you'll have to experience to continue your progress.</p>

        If you are unable to lift heavy/light weights due to joint, weight, or other health issues don't worry there are still awesome alternatives. The best being cardio such as walking at a decent pace. As long as you're being active an hour a day that is all that matters. 
      If walking is difficult for you the best overall activity is swimming by far, the joints are mostly relaxed in water. completing an hour worth of cardio in the water goes by fast and you will be cool after instead of being all sweaty if that bothers you. 
      <br>
      Whichever plan you decide on, it's best to have a plan that follows getting a personal trainer, following safe habits, keeping tabs on your health during and after, and making sure to stay hydrated. I hope this section helped you out just a little on your health journy.
